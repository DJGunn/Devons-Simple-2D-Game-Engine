# Devons-Simple-2D-Game-Engine
A retired simple 2-D game engine base that I made and worked on as a hobby from 2012-2014. It most likely won't compile without edits. Posted here for posterity as a source of code samples and in case I ever decide to re-open and expand the project.


Dependencies:
SDL 2.x suite
TinyXML
Windows

I may begin work on it again one day. Not guaranteed to compile/function in its current state.

I did not create anything in the Includes folder, nor did I create anything of note in the Resources folder.

All of the code in the code folder save for tinyxml2.cpp & tinyxml2.h is my own original work.
